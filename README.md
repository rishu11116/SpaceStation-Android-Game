This is a small game just based on android fundamentals and basics of game mechanics.
The main components used in this game development are Android GraphicsAPI,Android MediaPlayerAPI,Android SurfaceViewAPI and many more.
The rules to play the game are quite simple:-
   # Player ship has to kill the enemies by colliding with them.
   # If player lets 10 enemies to go safely then the game is over.
   # Overall score is calculated on the basis of the distance travelled by the player ship.
